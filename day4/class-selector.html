        <h4>Targeting class attributes</h4>
        <p>In this example I want to target specific class attribute values. Note how the styling is applied regardless of element type. <em class="highlight">Class selectors are also more specific than element selectors</em>, so they allow us to overwrite the more general styles of element selectors.</p>
        <h4 class="highlight">Using class selectors</h4>
        <p>They also allow us to target very specific locations or instances by simply applying a <strong class="highlight">class attribute</strong>. This is a great way to write styles for specific purposes with a single selector and then apply it whenever needed by adding the appropriate class attribute.</p>
        <p>Care should be taken when using class selectors as overuse of them can bloat code and create stylesheets that are hard to maintain.</p>

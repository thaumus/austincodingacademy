                    <p>Descendent selectors allow us to be much more precise in terms of where styling is applied. Using them allows us to style elements a certain way when found inside a specific element type and another way if found elsewhere. This allows us to create discreet areas of styling in an efficient manner. <em>It also makes it easy to create self-contained elements</em>, as class and ID attributes can be used to identify specific UI elements that are styled with a combination of descendent selectors.</p>

                        <p>Because descendent selectors are tied directly to the structure of your HTML, it&rsquo;s difficult to plan any effective strategy for using them without first understanding how your site&rsquo;s content will be structured. The main focus of any strategy outlining the use of descendent selectors should be to strike a balance between specificity and modularity. You want your selectors to properly style the targeted area, but not to the detriment of adding styles later that may need to overwrite these base styles. </p>
                        <p>Also, care should be taken to write descendent selectors as efficiently as possible. <em>Any selector that requires over three selectors to construct can probably be rewritten in a more efficient manner</em>.</p>

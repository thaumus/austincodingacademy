        <h1>Hello</h1>

        <p>This is a paragraph that contains <span>several span tags</span>. I'd like to style these span tags across my <span>entire site at once</span>, to establish a default site-wide format for them. The most efficient selector for this would be the <span>element selector</span>, as it will allow me to establish a base-line format for the span tag with a <span>low degree of specificity</span>. This means that the formatting will be controlled throughout the entire site with a single selector, and it will be <span>easy to overwrite in specific instances</span> where I want the styling to change.</p>
